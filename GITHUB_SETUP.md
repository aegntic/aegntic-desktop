# Steps to Push to GitHub

Since we've prepared the local repository, here are the steps to create a GitHub repository and push this code to it:

## 1. Create the GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign in to your account
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Enter repository name: `aegntic-desktop`
4. Set the repository owner to: `aegntic` (or your organization/username)
5. Add a description: "An Electron application that integrates multiple AI chat services into a single desktop interface with Obsidian mindmap generation."
6. Choose repository visibility (Public or Private)
7. Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license as we already have those
8. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Push Your Local Repository

After creating the repository, GitHub will show instructions. Follow these terminal commands:

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project directory
cd /home/qubit/aegntic-desktop

# Add the GitHub repository as a remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/aegntic/aegntic-desktop.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

You'll be prompted to enter your GitHub credentials.

## 3. Verify the Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/aegntic/aegntic-desktop
2. Confirm that all files have been uploaded correctly
3. Verify the README is displaying properly

## Note

If you have two-factor authentication enabled on GitHub, you'll need to use a personal access token instead of your password. You can create one in GitHub's settings under Developer settings â†’ Personal access tokens.
