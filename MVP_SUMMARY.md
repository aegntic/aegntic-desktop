# Aegntic Desktop MVP Summary

## What We've Built

We've created a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the Aegntic Desktop application, which integrates multiple AI chat services into a single desktop interface with Obsidian mindmap generation capabilities.

### Core Features Implemented

1. **Unified Interface**: A clean React-based UI for interacting with multiple AI services
2. **Direct Browser Integration**: Uses Electron's BrowserView to embed authenticated browser sessions
3. **Model Selection**: Ability to select and send prompts to multiple AI models simultaneously
4. **Response Comparison**: View responses in tabs or side-by-side comparison
5. **Obsidian Integration**: Export conversations as mindmaps to an Obsidian vault

### Technical Implementation

- **React Frontend**: Modern UI with TypeScript for type safety
- **Electron Backend**: Manages browser sessions and connects to AI services
- **BrowserViews**: Hidden browser instances for each AI service
- **IPC Communication**: Message passing between the React UI and Electron main process
- **CSS Styling**: Clean, modern styling with a responsive design

## Architecture

Our MVP follows a layered architecture:

1. **UI Layer** (React Components):
   - MultiAIApp: Main application component
   - ModelSelector: Selection and login for AI models
   - PromptInput: User input for prompts
   - ResponseView: Displaying and comparing AI responses

2. **Communication Layer** (Electron IPC):
   - Bidirectional communication between UI and services

3. **Service Layer** (Electron Main Process):
   - BrowserIntegrator: Manages browser sessions and interactions
   - ResponseHandler: Processes and stores AI responses
   - ObsidianIntegrator: Generates mindmaps for Obsidian

## Next Steps for Enhancement

While the MVP implements the core functionality, there are several areas for future enhancement:

1. **Response Streaming**: Implement real-time streaming of AI responses
2. **Enhanced Session Management**: Better handling of login sessions and persistence
3. **Additional AI Services**: Support for more AI platforms
4. **UI Polish**: Improved design, animations, and responsiveness
5. **Error Handling**: More robust error handling and recovery
6. **Local Storage**: Save conversation history locally
7. **Settings Panel**: User configuration for preferences
8. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: For power users
9. **Advanced Mindmap Generation**: More sophisticated processing of AI responses for better mindmaps
10. **Testing**: Automated tests for core functionality

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions in the README.md and RUNNING.md files to set up and run the application. The basic workflow is:

1. Install dependencies with `npm install`
2. Start the development servers with `npm start`
3. Connect to your AI services via the login buttons
4. Start sending prompts and comparing responses

## Technical Debt & Limitations

The current MVP has a few limitations to be aware of:

1. Error handling is minimal and may not gracefully recover from all failures
2. The UI is functional but could benefit from additional polish
3. Session management is basic and may require manual intervention
4. No automated testing has been implemented yet
5. The application assumes working internet connections to AI services

Despite these limitations, the MVP demonstrates the core concept and provides a solid foundation for future development.
